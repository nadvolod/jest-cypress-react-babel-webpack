## Getting started

```npm i```

```npm run dev``` to start the app at http://localhost:8080/


> Note: This project is intentionally over-engineered. The application itself is
> very simple, but the tooling around it is pretty complicated. The goal is to
> show what configuration would be like for a large real-world application
> without having all the extra complexities of a real-world application.
